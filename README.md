# Math by voice input

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

(Note: This is a WiP, I'm sorry if my project seems unfinnished when you're reading this... also I can barely code at all in Python so there will be no codes (right now at least...) Thank you!)

When doing math problems sites such as Wolfram Alpha can be very helpful in helping you with basically any and all math problems (except maybe those at the highest of levels), but you as a user must still understand how to format, write and apply the math problems in a correct way. My project idea is to create an AI that can understand, and analyse voice commands to help the user solve math problems, without the need to use a computer or write in programs such as Latex etc. By just using voice commands you can tell the program what you need help with, or what math problem you want help solving, without the need for hard-to-understand text.


## Background

My idea helps people who might not be very well versed in writing advanced math formulas easily explain their math problem. It makes math easier to learn and understand by removing the need to write the equations down, which can be both time consuming and confusing for those that might struggle with maths.

What my idea will help with:
* No needing to write equations in Latex.
* No need to translate advanced math problems to english when using the internet for help.
* No need to use text for those with dyslexia, dyscalculia or bad eyesight etc.


## How is it used?

The idea is for the user to talk to the program and describe the math problem i.e. "long division" and the program will then give information about said math problem and try to help the user. If the user has a more specific problem and needs help with an entire equation, the user can then just read out the equation as is, and the program will then try to translate the words into text in real-time and then try to solve the math problem with a step-by-step explanation for the user.

## Challenges

I can't code in python, and trying to make system that can understand and translate voice commands into math formulas will most likely not be something one person can do by themsleves. If a program like mine already exists then I'll just be happy knowing people with a phone or computer have a better access to solving math problems by themselves than I had when I was in primary school for instance.

## What next?

As mentioned above, my project will probably need a small (or large) team of programmers and designers to actually make work in real life. Furthermore I don't know how accessible the program would be for younger students since programs and apps like these tend to cost money, or require a monthly subscription fees. My dream is for this program to be accessible to all students, young and older when needing help in math class, without the need of a teacher, friend or familiy member to be nearby.
