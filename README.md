# Math by voice input

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

When doing math problems sites such as Wolfram Alpha can be very helpful in helping you with basically any and all math problems (except maybe those at the highest of levels), but you as a user must still understand how to format, write and apply the math problems in a correct way. My project idea is to create an AI that can understand, and analyse voice commands to help the user solve math problems, without the need to use a computer or write in programs such as Latex etc. By just using voice commands you can tell the program what you need help with, or what math problem you want help solving, without the need for hard-to-understand text.


## Background

My idea helps people who might not be very well versed in writing advanced math formulas easily explain their math problem. It makes math easier to learn and understand by removing the need to write the equations down, which can be both time consuming and confusing for those that might struggle with maths.

What my idea will help with:
* No needing to writ equations in Latex.
* No need to translate advanced math problems to english when using the internet for help.
* No need to use text for those with dyslexia, bad eyesight etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The idea is for the user to 

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
